<h2>About the app</h2>
<p>The purpose of this app is to provide a visualization of DEM files loaded on your SD card. If there are none, a sample file will be loaded. A slider at the bottom lets you set the elevation, below which everything will be shaded in. This is handy for quickly finding the lowest and highest points in an area.</p>

<h2>Markers</h2>
<p>To add a marker, click the 'Add Marker' button in the top right corner then tap on the map. They can be dragged, removed, or have their text visibility toggled.</p>
<h2>Location Tracking</h2>
<p>When enabled, your location is set by GPS. When disabled, it is set by a draggable marker.</p>
<h2>Follow Elevation</h2>
<p>When this mode is enabled the water level will be set to match your current elevation. </p>
<h2>Drawing Modes</h2>
<p>The DEM can be displayed as all blue or with a color gradient, with optional transparency for both. The transparency level can be adjusted in the settings menu.</p>
